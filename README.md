A junior software developer with full-stack open source experience. Having worked on collaborative projects with other junior developers at Makers Academy, I've built a well rounded knowledge enabling me to contribute effectively as part of a multi disciplinary team. Having worked with developers from a recruitment standpoint for the past few years I have become passionate about the industry and am now looking to secure my first position as a junior developer making best use of my experience with Ruby & Javascript, in an Agile environment.

## Skills

#### Client facing

Having worked in the recruitment industry for the past 7 years I have gained the ability to work closely with clients including pitching and presenting to clients. I believe these skills will be highly transferrable in tech as I work with clients, internal stakeholders and end users to sell solutions and explain technical problems in layman's terms.

#### Ruby

I've been using Ruby to develop web applications since June 2017 and have a well rounded understanding. Starting out with a rudimentary knowledge I increased my ability through coding challenges. Throughout the course I aim to continue to advance my ability with Ruby at pace to a highly competent level.


#### Javascript

I started working with Javascript around 5 years ago and have taken a number of online courses to broaden my understanding. Although still at a junior level, I am confident with the fundamentals and hope to continue to improve in my next role.
