A junior software developer with full-stack open source experience. Having worked on collaborative projects with other junior developers at Makers Academy, I've built a well rounded knowledge enabling me to contribute effectively as part of a multi disciplinary team. Having worked with developers from a recruitment standpoint for the past few years I have become passionate about the industry and am now looking to secure my first position as a junior developer making best use of my foundation in Agile development. I am open to working with all technologies though currently I'm strongest working with Ruby and Javascript. I'm currently continuing to build my knowledge of React and am also learning Python and Java in a bid to continue my personal development after the course. Please feel free to look at any code examples on my Github (recent is better) and get in contact for a chat.

### Skills
#### Ruby
I've been using Ruby to develop web applications since June 2017 and have a well rounded understanding. Starting out with a rudimentary knowledge I increased my ability through coding challenges. Since I joined Makers Academy I have become very confident with Ruby and am very competent in the full stack development of web applications using Ruby coupled with Sinatra or Rails.

#### Javascript
I started working with Javascript around 5 years ago and have taken a number of online courses to broaden my understanding. Although still at a junior level, I am confident with the fundamentals and hope to continue to improve in my next role. Whilst at Makers Academy I have built a number of projects using different Javascript design patterns and always try to stay up to date with the latest frameworks. I've worked with NodeJS, jQuery, React and vanilla javascript and actively enjoy learning new frameworks.

#### Client facing
Having worked in the recruitment industry for the past 7 years I have gained the ability to work closely with clients including pitching and presenting to clients. I've also been working closely with developers in taking role requirements, discussing technical experience and pitching roles. I believe these skills will be highly transferrable in a development role as , internal stakeholders and end users to sell solutions and explain technical problems in layman's terms.
